    "- **Wind Arrows**: The blue arrows show wind direction and strength at different points in the grid.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Initial Windfields\n",
    "\n",
    "The wind field you can see in the previous rendering is generated based on parameters defined during environment creation. In the real challenge, you'll encounter several different initial wind fields:\n",

    "1. **Training Initial Windfields**: These are provided for you to develop and test your agent:\n",

    "- Base wind direction and strength\n",
    "- Spatial wind patterns across the grid\n",
    "- Pattern scales and strength variations\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand that while the initial windfields differ in their starting conditions, they all evolve over time according to the same underlying dynamics. This means that regardless of which initial windfield you're dealing with, the wind will follow similar evolution rules (perturbation amplitude, rotation rates, etc.) as time progresses within an episode. Think of the initial windfields as different starting points, but with consistent physics governing how they change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predefined initial windfields are available in the `initial_windfields` module and can be loaded using the `get_initial_windfield()` function. We'll explore these different initial windfields later in this notebook to understand how your agent will need to adapt to different wind conditions.\n",

    "## 9. Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You now have a comprehensive understanding of the sailing environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ You understand the physics of sailing and how wind angle affects efficiency  \n",
    "✅ You know the action space and how controls work  \n",
    "✅ You understand the observation space and what information is available to your agent  \n",
    "✅ You've seen how rewards are structured  \n",
    "✅ You're familiar with the different initial windfields and how they evolve over time  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move on to the next notebook to learn about creating and testing your agent\n",
    "2. Experiment with different strategies for navigating in various wind conditions\n",
    "3. Think about how to handle the \"no-go zone\" when sailing upwind\n",
    "4. Consider how to optimize your path given the initial wind conditions and their evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the key challenge is creating an agent that can generalize across different initial windfields, particularly the hidden test initial windfield. Your agent needs to adapt both to the starting wind configurations and how they change over time. Good luck with your sailing agent!"
