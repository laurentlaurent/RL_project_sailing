    "- **Fine-tune your agent**: Use the performance metrics to identify areas for improvement\n",
    "- **Test across all initial windfields**: Ensure your agent can handle different wind patterns\n",
    "- **Optimize for efficiency**: Aim to reach the goal in fewer steps\n",
    "- **Consider advanced strategies**: Experiment with algorithms that better account for wind physics\n",
